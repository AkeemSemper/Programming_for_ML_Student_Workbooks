    "<li> What are the inputs? (I.e. what do you have to get started?) </li>\n",
    "<li> These two steps basically define the start and end of a function that does what you need. </li>\n",
    "<li> What are the steps in between? Be sure to break the problem down into smaller steps. In words, not code. </li>\n",
    "<li> Walk through one execution in your head or on paper - are any steps missing, ambiguous, or actually made up of more steps and need more breaking down? </li>\n",
    "<li> Along the way, does that need any \"additons\" - new variables, pulling input from somewhere else, etc? </li>\n",
    "<li> Start the write the code, each step should translate into a line or two of code, since you have already broken it down. </li>\n",
    "<li> If you don't know how to do a step, it is now one specific thing, look for it in documentation or google \"python [thing you need to do]\" </li>\n",
    "<li> Place print statements throughout the code that print out the values of variables as they are being changed, so you can see what is happening, and check for correctness as you go. </li>\n",
    "<li> Test the code with a few different inputs to make sure it works. </li>\n",

Remember, this needs to be generic - so any dataframe should work, with any number/names of numeric and non-numeric columns. You'll also want to test this, so either pull in or create some data that allows you to test. If you're creating data, it is possible to automatically create random values, google that if needed. I personally would use some dataset for testing. "
